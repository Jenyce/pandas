# pandas
Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Pandas is a NUMFocus sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project.

## ¶Pandas: Powerful Python data analysis toolkit¶
Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

Pandas has significantly improved support for operations involving unsigned,or purely non-negative, integers. Previously, handling these integers would result in improper rounding or data-type casting, leading to incorrect results.
  
### Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:

**Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet**

**Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.**

**Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels**

**Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure**
